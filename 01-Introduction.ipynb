    "Degrees of freedom, in a mechanics context, are specific, defined modes in which a mechanical device or system can move. The number of degrees of freedom is equal to the total number of independent displacements or aspects of motion. A machine may operate in two or three dimensions but have more than three degrees of freedom. The term is widely used to define the motion capabilities of robots.[Link](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/degrees-of-freedom)\n",

    "* (c) The configuration of a coin in three-dimensional space is given by the three coordinates of A, two angles to the point B on the sphere of radius dAB centered at A, and one angle to the point C on the circle defined by the intersection of the a sphere centered at A and a sphere centered at B.\n",
